# Infrastructure configuration files

These are some Terraform and Ansible implementations that will simplify the set up of some complex infrastructure. Current there is an [Apache Kafka set up for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Phantom-Intruder/infrastructure-configs/tree/master/terraform/kafka) using Terraform, and a [multi-node Jenkins set up](https://github.com/Phantom-Intruder/infrastructure-configs/tree/master/ansible/jenkins) with Ansible. A chef inspec setup is also in progress.
